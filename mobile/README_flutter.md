# Flutter Mobile App (Skeleton)

This folder contains notes and a suggested app structure for a cross-platform mobile app built with Flutter.

Suggested features:
- Live traffic map (integrate Google Maps SDK) with overlays from backend API.
- Push notifications for major incidents (Firebase Cloud Messaging).
- Smart parking finder (poll backend for free spots).
- Police controls (secured via login).

For hackathon deliverable: A minimal Flutter prototype can be built, but for time-saving you can instead build a React Native/Flutter UI prototype and link to the backend REST API endpoints described in `backend/app.py`.
